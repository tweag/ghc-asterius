-- | Returns a list of blocks reachable from the provided Labels in the reverse
-- postorder.
--
-- This is the most important traversal over this data structure.  It drops
-- unreachable code and puts blocks in an order that is good for solving forward
-- dataflow problems quickly.  The reverse order is good for solving backward
-- dataflow problems quickly.  The forward order is also reasonably good for
-- emitting instructions, except that it will not usually exploit Forrest
-- Baskett's trick of eliminating the unconditional branch from a loop.  For
-- that you would need a more serious analysis, probably based on dominators, to
-- identify loop headers.
--
-- For forward analyses we want reverse postorder visitation, consider:
-- @
--      A -> [B,C]
--      B -> D
--      C -> D
-- @
-- Postorder: [D, C, B, A] (or [D, B, C, A])
-- Reverse postorder: [A, B, C, D] (or [A, C, B, D])
-- This matters for, e.g., forward analysis, because we want to analyze *both*
-- B and C before we analyze D.

    -- * @ConsTodo@ means to explore the block if it wasn't visited before
    -- * @ConsMark@ means that all successors were already done and we can add
    --   the block to the result.

    -- them (i.e., we use @(:)@), which means that the final list is in reverse
